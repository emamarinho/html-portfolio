<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've recently finished BSc in Biology at Faculdade FCUP, while undertaking a curricular internship at CIIMAR in the third year. Also, I serve as the Coordinator of the Recreative and Cultural Department at NEBUP, hold membership in the Recreative and Cultural Department at AEFCUP and play for AEFCUP's volleyball team.</p>

<p>In the upcoming year, I plan to pursue a Post-Graduation in Software Development, leveraging the skills acquired during my internship and learn new ones.</p>

<p>I am distinguished by my organizational prowess, adept time management, collaborative spirit and leadership abilities.</p>

<p>During my leisure time, I indulge in activities such as listening to music, watching classic films, crafting poetry and participating in volleyball matches.</p>
